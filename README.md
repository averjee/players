To build the app do the following:

1. Clone using the clone command: 

   git clone https://github.com/averjee/players.git


2. You will need to host the game on a server to run the game as the game uses Pixi JS which needs a web host to  run.  If you haven't got a server you can create a simple local  server by running the following command within the game directory you just cloned:

   npm install http-server -g
   
   http-server -c-1


3. Run the game using the available servers generated e.g. http://127.0.0.1:8080
